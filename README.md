# SQL-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
In this project, the aim is to use SQL to analyse fictive sales data of a company. The data is already cleaned data provided and is not attached to a particular organisation. The code used in creating the database is available as well all the questions to be answered.

The database is made up of three tables:staff, customers and sales.

Below are snapshots of each of those tables.
